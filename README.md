This player aid for Insider will:
1. Distribute the secret roles.
2. Pick a secret word for you, or let you choose your own, and only show it to the appropriate players.
3. Provide a 5-minute sand timer, that you can flip when the secret word is guessed.

This code powers https://insider-online.herokuapp.com - where you can play the game.

It is based on Evan Brumley's Crabhat Spyfall, which was succeeded by tannerkrewson and can be played here: https://spyfall.tannerkrewson.com/
